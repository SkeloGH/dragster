# dragster

A drag racing game based on phaser.js, running on node.

## How to install/run the app:

- Clone the project.
- `cd` into the project.
- `npm install`
- `node app.js`

It will run the app on port 3000, then you just go to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/game/` and you'll be set!

## Controls
- [UP arrow] shift up.
- [DOWN arrow] shift down.
- [LEFT arrow] brake.
- [LEFT arrow] accelerate.

## Implementation so far
- Racing stage: basic elements rendering and gearboxed movement, you actually need to shift up to get the car into 1st gear, so no race, yet.
